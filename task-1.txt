TitaniumCore: High-Speed File Analysis Engine

Overview
TitaniumCore delivers millisecond-speed file analysis for detecting advanced threats. 

Key Capabilities

Advanced Analysis Engine
TitaniumCore analyses files with millisecond response times through its optimized processing engine. The system:
•	Processes samples at any volume scale
•	Supports enterprise-level deployments
•	Provides deterministic threat detection results

Flexible Rules Configuration
The threat detection system uses a dual-source rules engine:
•	Built-in ReversingLabs rule definitions
•	Customer-supplied YARA rules
•	Combined scoring mechanism for precise threat level determination

Automated Processing Workflow
Files can be automatically routed based on analysis results:
•	Route to additional analysis tools (decompilers, debuggers, sandboxes, virtual machine environments)
•	Forward to security analysts based on threat level or file type
•	Optimize security resource allocation through intelligent routing

Comprehensive Threat Intelligence
TitaniumCore provides detailed threat intelligence including file metadata, behavioural indicators, and structural analysis not available in single-purpose tools.
